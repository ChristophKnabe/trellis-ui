# trellis-ui
A user interface for Trellis servers

The Trellis backend is assumed to be located at `http://localhost:8080/`, if that is different, set an
environment variable: `export REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://trellis.example.com/`.

When building via `npm build` be sure to verify the `homepage` value in `package.json`.

To start the development server, run `npm start`
